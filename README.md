# WeatherCast

A simple weather forecast application made with Flutter.

## Description

This project is a demo weather application I developed when I was learning Flutter. The main purpose of this project was to challenge myself and make a portfolio using what I learned during course. This project also can be used by who currently are learning flutter and looking for a sample project.

The idea originally came from [Angela Yu's Flutter Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/). UI design inspired by [Weather App](https://dribbble.com/shots/11474539-Weather-App).
